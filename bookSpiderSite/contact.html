				<h3> Using BookSpider </h3>
				<p> Using BookSpider is as simple as performing a google search. Simply navigate to our <a href="search.html">search page</a> and type in the name of the book you are looking for. You can also search for an author, IBSN, specific editions or years published, etc. After our spiders have crawled the web in search of your book they will return links to websites in which you can download your book. The results are generated in a table showing you the website name, book title, author, IBSN, and link to the page containing the download link. 
					<br>
					<br>
					If you have suggestions for websites in which you have had success obtaining free versions of books before and would like us to include said website in our program, please send us a <a href="contact.html">message</a>!
